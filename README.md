Number Guessing Game (C++)
This project is a Number Guessing Game developed using C++ as part of my C++ Programming Internship at CODSOFT (Task 1).
The program generates a random number, and the user tries to guess it. The program provides feedback until the correct number is guessed.
Features:
Random number generation
User input handling
Looping until the correct guess
Feedback for each guess (too high / too low)
Beginner-friendly C++ logic
Technologies Used:
Language: C++
Concepts Used:
Variables
Loops
Conditional statements
Random number generation
How the Game Works:
The program generates a random number.
The user is asked to guess the number.
The program checks the guess:
If the guess is too high, it asks to try again.
If the guess is too low, it asks to try again.
The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
A success message is displayed.
How to Run the Program:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-guessing-game.git
Navigate to the project folder:
cd number-guessing-game
Compile the program:
g++ number_guessing_game.cpp -o game
Run the program:
./game
Learning Outcome:
Improved understanding of C++ basics
Practiced logic building and problem solving
Learned how to create an interactive console-based game
